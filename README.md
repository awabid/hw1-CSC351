Awais Abid - HW1 
There are 3 branches (master, fork() final, and threads() final).
They are mostly identical, except each is set up (main.c, makefile) for testing a particular multi-client implementation:

-- master() can be Built to test the Multi-client Support with select() (Part 5 of HW1)
-- fork() final can be Built to test Multi-client Support with fork()  (Part 4 of HW1)
-- threads() final can be Built to test Multi-client Support with Multithreading (Part 6 of HW1)
